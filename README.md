👋🏻 Hi, I’m Isabelle! As a UX Designer with experience across enterprise SaaS and e-commerce, I’m passionate about crafting solutions that bridge research with strategy to enhance user experiences while driving business growth.

At SAP, my work focuses on building design systems to enhance cross-product consistency, innovating analytic capabilities in SAP’s AI copilot Joule, and optimizing mobile experiences for SAP Analytics Cloud.

As a driven and goal-oriented individual, I thrive on continual learning, fostering curiosity, and empowering others to achieve their goals.

Outside of work, I love staying active and exploring the outdoors. I enjoy playing golf, snowboarding, and hiking in beautiful BC. I've also represented Team Canada internationally as a competitive powerlifter, earning four silver medals at the 2023 North American Powerlifting Championships!
