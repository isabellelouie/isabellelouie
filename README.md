👋🏻 Hi! I’m Isabelle, a UX researcher and product designer transforming user insights into meaningful experiences. Welcome to my portfolio: https://isabellelouie.com/

As an experienced communications specialist fascinated by the intersection of marketing and design, my passion lies in understanding user behaviour and transforming insights into impactful, data-driven solutions. As a goal-driven individual myself, my mission is to help others achieve their goals through meaningful designs that address their needs and enhance everyday experiences.

I am currently in my final semester at Simon Fraser University, completing a joint major in Business and Interactive Arts and Technology. I am eagerly seeking opportunities in User Experience Research and Product Design for Summer 2024.

Outside of school and work, I compete in powerlifting and represent Team Canada internationally!
