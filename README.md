👋🏻 Hi! I’m Isabelle, a UX researcher and designer transforming user insights into meaningful experiences. Welcome to my portfolio: https://isabellelouie.com/

As a T-shaped designer, my strengths in user research are complemented by a diverse background in experience design, business strategy, communications, and marketing.

My passion lies in understanding user behaviour and transforming insights into impactful solutions that enhance everyday experiences. As a goal-oriented individual, I am driven by my love for continual learning, embracing curiosity, and helping others achieve their goals.

I am currently in my final semester at Simon Fraser University, completing a joint major in Business and Interactive Arts and Technology. Outside of school and work, I am an avid powerlifter and have represented Team Canada internationally!
