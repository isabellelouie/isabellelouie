👋🏻 Hi! I’m Isabelle, a UX researcher and designer transforming user insights into meaningful experiences. Welcome to my portfolio: https://isabellelouie.com/

As a T-shaped professional, I specialize in mixed methods research with a wide array of skills in experience design, business strategy, communications, and marketing. As a goal-oriented individual, I am driven by my love for continual learning, embracing curiosity, and helping others achieve their goals.

I am currently in my final semester at Simon Fraser University, completing a joint major in Business and Interactive Arts and Technology. I am eagerly seeking opportunities in User Experience Research for Summer 2024.

Outside of school and work, I am an avid powerlifter and represent Team Canada internationally. Most recently, I earned four silver medals for Canada at the 2023 North American Powerlifting Championships in the Cayman Islands!
